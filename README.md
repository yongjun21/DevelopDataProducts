## Segmented Linear Regression

This is a project I did as part of my Coursera JHU Developing Data Product course back in Mar 2015. Here I created an interactive application for performing Segmented Linear Regression using Shiny.

You'll also find here a HTML5 presentation of my project. Check out the links below:
